                        We are a unique rock/dubstep band, DJ, and music
                        producer based in England. Our music is a fusion of
                        traditional rock and roll elements with modern dubstep
                        beats and electronic soundscapes.

                        We are proud to have travelled around the world and
                        played at numerous venues, bringing our music to fans
                        across the globe. Our band was formed in 2006 by Jackson
                        Ramirez, Marcus Lee, Ethan Cruz and Nathan Kim. We
                        started out playing small gigs at local bars and clubs,
                        but quickly gained a following for our innovative sound
                        and high-energy performances. Our first EP, Solaria, was
                        released in 2009 and received critical acclaim for its
                        fresh approach to rock music. Since then, we have
                        released several more albums and EPs, each showcasing
                        our evolving sound and musical abilities.

                        We have been fortunate enough to collaborate with some
                        amazing artists and producers, and we are always seeking
                        new opportunities to push the boundaries of what's
                        possible in music. In addition to our work as a band, we
                        also produce and DJ electronic music under the name
                        Edset Soundsystem. This allows us to experiment with new
                        sounds and genres, and provides a platform for us to
                        showcase our skills as producers and DJs. We are
                        constantly working to improve our craft and bring our
                        fans the best possible music. Thank you for visiting our
                        website, and we hope to see you at one of our shows
                        soon!
